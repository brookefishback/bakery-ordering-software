A simple bakery software that takes customer orders

Project requirements: 
A local bakery has asked you to design a simple order screen that runs continuously and allows any number of users to place an order.

Write a short script
-A numbered list of baked goods is displayed for sale
-Each item has 5 in stock when the program starts
-User can enter the ID (1, 2, 3, etc.) of the item they want
-User can enter how much of the item they want
-Stock for each item decreases as they are ordered
-If no more of an item is available, the user is told their order cannot be fulfilled.
HINTS:
-Use if statements to handle different cases
-Use a while loop to run the program continuously
-You can choose whatever items you want, but you should probably have a variable for each itemâ€™s stock
